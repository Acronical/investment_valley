# Investment Valley
CINF-405 Team Project

## How to run the game:
- cd to  `investment_valley`  folder
- setup and activate Python Virtual Enviroment (Optional)
- make sure Pygame is installed, I used `pip3 install pygame` on my Mac
- type  `python3 code/game.py`  to run the game

## Need to be done:
- [ ] player can "talk" to building, and shows a dialog window
- [ ] make graphs showing the price trend for stock, crypto, and real estate trading
- [ ] player can sell and buy stocks, crypto, houses when interacting with corresponding building
- [ ] functions for casino, lottery, bank
- [ ] set a timer for 5 min

## Done: 
- [x] label each building with names "stock exchange", "casino"...
- [x] player can move using arrow keys
- [x] 5 buildings with collision detection, so player cannot move across each building
- [x] player animations
- [x] game map and builidng images
